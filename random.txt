O God! can I not grasp
Thus much let me avow--
You are not wrong, who deem
Of a surf-tormented shore,
Through my fingers to the deep,
Grains of the golden sand--
But a dream within a dream?That my days have been a dream;
Thus much let me avow--
Take this kiss upon the brow!
Is all that we see or seem
Thus much let me avow--
Grains of the golden sand--

O God! can I not save
In a vision, or in none,
