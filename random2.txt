All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.
In a vision, or in none,
Take this kiss upon the brow!
Thus much let me avow--
And, in parting from you now,
O God! can I not grasp
All that we see or seem
While I weep--while I weep!
But a dream within a dream?All that we see or seem
While I weep--while I weep!
In a vision, or in none,
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision, or in none,
How few! yet how they creep
While I weep--while I weep!
Them with a tighter clasp?
Yet if hope has flown away
You are not wrong, who deem
Is all that we see or seem
And, in parting from you now,
You are not wrong, who deem
But a dream within a dream?Through my fingers to the deep,
